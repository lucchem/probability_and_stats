    "It can be modeled as a Markov chain, where $m+1$ states are present, from 0 to $m$, equal to the number of faces already appeared. Clearly, $m$ is an absorbing state, and the following equations for the conditional probabilities hold:\n",
    "$$ p_0 = p_1,\\quad p_i=\\frac in p_i+\\left(1-\\frac in\\right)p_{i+1}\\,i\\in\\{1,..,m-1\\}\\Rightarrow p_i=p_{i+1},\\quad p_m=1\\Rightarrow p_i=1.$$\n",
    "It means that no matter what, before or after the game will be over.\n",
    "Also, the expected cost can be estimated as the average time to absorption:\n",
    "$$ t_0 = 1+t_1,\\quad t_i=1+\\frac in t_i+\\left(1-\\frac in\\right)t_{i+1}\\,i\\in\\{1,..,m-1\\}\\Rightarrow t_i=\\frac i{n-i}+t_{i+1},\\quad t_m=0.$$\n",
